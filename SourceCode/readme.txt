This is a readme file on how to use the sample script

Description of some important files

1. script2.m  
    This is the main file to be executed. The file will call the segmentation algorithm,
    perform evaluations and print the result in the report.txt in the [result] folder.

2.  Energy.m 
    The energy function. This file is called from file Algorithm1.m. The function 
    receive Y, the signal and P the window size. It will return the energy per frame

3. Algorithm1.m
    The file is the segmentation algorithm used in the class example. This will be 
    the benchmark algorithm. This function is called from script2.m. The function receive Y, 
    the signal, Thres  which is the  threshold value as deciding factor to select 
    segentation point and win, the window size. It will return the list of automatic 
    segmentation and number of auto segmentation points

4. Find_Match.m
   Purpose is to find the Match points given the segmentation points and reference points. 
   The function receive V, the reference points and U, the segmentation points and alos 
   Time tolerence in second. It will return the number of Match witin the given time tolerence.


What you need to do


1. All modification is in script2.m
2. Try your data with the bench-mark algorithm (Algorihm1)
3. Test with different Threshold, Time Tolerence
4. Get the Match Rate,P(M) Omission Rate,P(O) and Insertion Rate,P(I) at the 
   folder [result] file record.txt.
5. use different threshold.
6. Use diffeent time tolerence {0.0, 0.04, 0.08,0.12,0.16.0.2 }
7. For each test copy the result and plot all the perfromance.
8. Conclude your experiment for the bench mark algorithm.
9. Repeat 1 - 8 using your own algorithm.
10. Compare and report your work.
